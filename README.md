#AI Generated Text Detection ðŸš€

This project aims to detect AI-generated essays using deep learning models. With the increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for content generation, distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated text has become a crucial challenge, especially in academic settings.

This repository includes the dataset, preprocessing steps, deep learning models, evaluation metrics, and insights derived from analyzing AI vs. human-generated essays.
